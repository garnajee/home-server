# Recyclarr

[Recyclarr](https://github.com/recyclarr/recyclarr) will help you to automate the configuring Radarr/Sonarr qualites.

You'll find here the following instructions to be able to download files in that specific quality:

- `MULTi` (Original version + Truefrench (in my case))
- `1080p`
- `h264`
- and no `HDR` or `10 bits`.
